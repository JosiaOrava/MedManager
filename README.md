# MedManager

This android app was done in school mobile developement course by me, Jori Anola-Pukkila and Jura Makkonen. We made app for people to write down all
medications that they need to remember for each day and then app will remind them to take meds when it's time.

# What I learned
This project gave me real hands on experience on mobile developing. It was done with Java and was also my first touch to Java so I learned a lot about it.
It also gave me perspective on how much is going on in the background even in really simple app like this.
